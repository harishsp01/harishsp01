<p style="font-size:12px;"> <i>Letters of Recommendation</i> </p>
	
<p style="font-size:12px;"> I am happy to write a letter of recommendation to support your academic and professional pursuits. In the past, these have generally included letters for scholarships, graduate school applications, internships and fellowships. </p>
	
<p style="font-size:12px;"> I can write a strong letter when you have either worked with me (1) as a research co-author, or (2) as a research assistant, or (3) on your honors thesis, or (4) on an independent study. These interactions give me an idea of your ability, skills, interests and motivation -- qualities that I can reference in the letter. I can also write a strong letter if you have taken a class with me (especially upper-level seminar courses) and have been an engaging student during the class. If you are unsure of whether I am an appropriate faculty member to write a recommendation letter on your behalf, please do not hesitate to reach out.</p>
	
<p style="font-size:12px;"> Please approach me at about the recommendation letter at least one month before the due date. After I have agreed to write the letter, I will need the below information from you:</p>

<ul>
<li style="font-size:12px">  Application Procedure:
<ul>
<li style="font-size:12px"> for an online submission, please email me a link </li>
<li style="font-size:12px"> for a paper submission, please email me the PDF of a blank recommendation form and also give me the mailing address for the letter </li>
</ul>
		
<li style="font-size:12px"> Submission Materials: These could include a cover letter, writing sample, statement of purpose or research proposal.</li>

<li style="font-size:12px"> Resume/CV: If you are unsure on how to prepare one, please consult the resourceful people at the Cohen Career Center</li>

<li style="font-size:12px"> Specific Emphasis: Anything specific that you would like me to emphasize in the letter</li>

<li style="font-size:12px"> Deadline: Let me know the precise deadline for the recommendation letter. Please also email me one week before this date and confirm that I have everything I need for the letter.</li>

</ul>

	
<p style="font-size:12px;"> I will send you an email once the letter is submitted. Please keep me posted on the outcome. </p>
<p style="font-size:12px;"> Good luck! </p>
