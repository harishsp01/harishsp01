<p class="spacing"> I am an Assistant Professor in the Government Department at the College of William & Mary. I am on leave in Fall 2019, and will be a Visiting Associate Research Scholar at the Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance, Princeton University.</p>

<p class="spacing"> Previously I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Global Governance at the Institute for the Study of International Development, McGill University. I specialize in political economy of development with an emphasis on state capacity, political violence and energy access, especially in Southeast and South Asia. I have a PhD in Political Science from New York University, and a Masters in International Relations from the S.Rajaratnam School of International Studies. </p>
