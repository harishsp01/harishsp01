    <h3><a id = "about" style="color:black">About</a></h3>

    <p> I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.wm.edu/as/government/index.php">Government Department</a> at the <a href="https://www.wm.edu/">College of William & Mary</a>. I am on leave in Fall 2019, and will be a Visiting Associate Research Scholar at the <a href="https://niehaus.princeton.edu/">Niehaus Center for Globalization and Governance</a>, <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a>.
    </p>

    <p> Previously I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Global Governance at the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/isid/">Institute for the Study of International Development</a>, <a href="https://mcgill.ca/">McGill University</a>. I specialize in political economy of development with an emphasis on state capacity, political violence and energy access, especially in Southeast and South Asia. I have a PhD in <a href="http://as.nyu.edu/politics.html">Political Science</a> from <a href="http://www.nyu.edu/">New York University</a>, and a Masters in International Relations from the <a href="https://www.rsis.edu.sg/">S.Rajaratnam School of International Studies</a>.

  <h4>
  <a href="syllabus/PoliticsofInequality_Spring2019Syllabus.pdf"><i>Politics of Inequality</a> (last offered Spring 2019)</i>
  </h4>
  <p>
  Inequality is central to many sociopolitical issues, and this course is designed to provide you with a critical understanding of the concept. We will begin with a historical review of the concept followed by the main issues surrounding the measurement of inequality. Next we will examine inequality between countries: why are some countries richer than others? How have these differences changed over time? Following that, we will study inequality within countries: how does the distribution of power affect the distribution of resources, and what policies exacerbate economic and political inequality within a society? In the third part of the course, we will study the link between inequality and various sociopolitical issues like ethnicity, gender, democracy, war and technology. To address these issues, we will use a combination of theoretical and empirical material, and discuss both historical and contemporary cases. At the end of the course, you will (1) gain a good understanding of the main issues surrounding the politics of inequality; (2) understand the reasons behind inequality both between and within countries; and (3) comprehend how inequality is related to other important social and political issues.

  <h4>
  <a href = "syllabus/GISforSocialScience_Fall2018Syllabus.pdf"><i>GIS for Social Science/Policy Analysis</a> (last offered Fall 2018)</i>
  </h4>
  <p>
  This is an introductory level course to concepts of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in policy analysis. Students can expect to learn the basics of GIS and use relevant software to analyze spatial data. The first part of the course focuses on the technical aspects of GIS - students will learn how to make a good map, how to collect and present spatial data, work with different projection systems, and digitize historical maps. The assignments will give students the opportunity to apply theoretical concepts into practice, and gain hands-on experience with ESRI ArcGIS software. In the second part of the course, we will discuss social science papers that use spatial data, and understand how GIS concepts have been used in the academic literature. Students will learn how to critically analyze such papers and incorporate spatial analysis in their own research projects.

  <h4>
  <a href ="syllabus/SEAsianDemocracy_Spring2018Syllabus.pdf"><i>Southeast Asian Autocracy & Democracy</a> (last offered Spring 2018)</i>
  </h4>
  <p>
  This class combines theoretical and empirical approaches to the study of Southeast Asian democracy and autocracy. We will first examine definitional issues surrounding democracy/autocracy and its applicability to different countries in the region (Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Vietnam, Cambodia, Thailand & Myanmar). Next we will examine causes of democracy/autocracy, the structure of military regimes, dominant party regimes, electoral authoritarianism, authoritarian institutions, democratization and economic development. We will discuss each theme in detail and understand how they apply in different Southeast Asian contexts. At the end of the course, you will (1) gain a good understanding of the major theoretical approaches to the study of democracy and autocracy; (2) understand on how to evaluate these theories in the Southeast Asian context. The goals for you in this course is to also learn how to ask good research questions, conduct a literature review, develop an argument that makes an original contribution, and communicate your findings to your peers.
  </p>

  <h4>
  <a href ="syllabus/PoliticsOfSoutheastAsia_Fall2017Syllabus.pdf"><i>Politics of Southeast Asia</a> (last offered Fall 2017)</i>
  </h4>
  <p>
  This class is an introduction to Southeast Asian politics. In the first half of the class, we will discuss the politics of various Southeast Asian countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Vietnam, Thailand & Myanmar. While these countries will give you a good foundation to understand Southeast Asia, you are encouraged to read more broadly about the issues. In the second half of the class, we will focus on thematic issues that aect the region: autocratic survival, democratization, economic development, identity politics, rebellion and political violence. During each thematic week, we will discuss the current theoretical literature and use empirical examples from different Southeast Asian countries to answer important political and economic questions. The course readings will use a combination of individual country studies, statistical data and inference, field experiments, qualitative case comparisons, and historical maps. At the end of the course, you will (1) gain a good understanding of the historical and contemporary issues surrounding Southeast Asian politics; (2) compare and contrast the experiences of different Southeast Asian countries to advance a theoretical argument; and (3) acquire up-to date knowledge on the field of Southeast Asian politics and its contribution to our understanding of important political science theories.

  In addition, I have given guest lectures on Mapping Conflict and also conducted a short ArcGIS Workshop. Previously, I served as a teaching assistant for courses on Basic/Advanced Game Theory and International Security.
